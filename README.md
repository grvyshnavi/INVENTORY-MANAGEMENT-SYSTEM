# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Build a Python program to manage inventory for a store or warehouse. The system should
allow users to add, edit, and delete products, track inventory levels, and generate reports
such as low- stock alerts or sales summaries. Implement features like user authentication,
data validation, and graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
